#Testing
#Motivations:
  #Find bugs (duh)
  #Forces you to think about code/interfaces/assumptions

#Different Testing Religions:
  # - Never
  # - When the going gets tough
  # - After the code is written
  # - Test-first
  # - Test-driven-development

#Red/Green/Refactor
#Cycle of:
  # - Write a failing test
  # - Write code to make the test pass
  # - Refactor code and tests


#One test module per application module
#All you need to do to test is "use ExUnit.Case"
