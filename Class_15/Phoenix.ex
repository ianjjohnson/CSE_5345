#The web has moved on:
  #mobile predominates
  #lots of non-human clients (IoT)
  #wireless replacing wired
  #ubiquitous access
  #concerns over energy use and heat output

#What rose out of the ashes... Phoenix!
#Phoenix is NOT a framework designed to deliver webpages

#It's a framework for writing server-side apps

#Phoenix:
  #Written in Elixir
  #OTP application
  #Scalable and reliable
  #Modern

#Can serve:
  #web pages
  #web clients
  #apps
  #basically anything that talks over TCP
