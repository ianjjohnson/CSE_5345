#There's a 4th supervision strategy
#The 4th supervision strategy is called simple_one_for_one

#This allows for dynamic allocation of children of a supervisor


#Genservers:
#Two main implementation styles:
  #Implementation "inside" server module
      #(interface and implementation together)
  #Implementation in separate module "outside"

#Review:
# Tasks: b/g process
# Agents: b/g state

# Spawn / monitor are foundation for
# OTP/ Genserver / Supervisor are foundation for
# Task and Agent (both are OTP servers (GenServers))
